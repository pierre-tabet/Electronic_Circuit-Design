/*! Read characters from the keyboard and echo them on the LCD. Assemble them
 * into a C-format string and return this when the End Input (*) key is pressed.
 *
 * \param [out] input_buffer An array of \a char to be used as a C-format
 * 		string. When the function exits, this must contain the
 * 		calculator input edited by the user.
 * \param [in] input_buffer_size The size of \a input_buffer, including
 * 		the trailing null.
 *
 * The function must wait until the first key is pressed. Until then,
 * the user may be reading the previous answer. Once the first key is pressed,
 * the display line used to echo input is cleared and a cursor is placed
 * at the start of that line. (You might decide to clear the other line too.)
 *
 * Then this function reads characters as they are entered. Each character is
 * 	- If it is A, B or C, translated into the display character. This
 * 		depends on whether the Shift key has been pressed.
 * 	- Entered into \a input_buffer.
 * 	- Displayed on the LCD at the next character position. The cursor
 * 		should then be moved to the next position, unless this would
 * 		move it beyond the end of the line.
 *
 * There are some special cases to consider:
 * 	- The software must keep track of whether the Shift key has
 * 		just been pressed.
 * 	- If the Rubout key is pressed, the previous character entry
 * 		must be undone. This means changing both the
 * 		\a input_buffer and the display. However, if the cursor
 * 		is already at the starting position nothing should
 * 		be done. You should also consider what to do if
 * 		the character to be rubbed out is Shift.
 * 	- If the End Input (*) key is pressed, the input is complete.
 * 		The function should return.
 * 	- The function should not accept more than
 * 		\a input_buffer_size-1 characters. The -1 is because one
 * 		space is reserved for the trailing null.
 * 		In the simple case, this will set a limit of 16 characters
 * 		which is all that will fit on one line of display.
 *
 * 		If the user types more characters, they should be
 * 		ignored: neither echoed nor added to \a input_buffer.
 * 		It would be useful to alert the user, e.g. by flashing
 * 		the display briefly and then re-displaying the
 * 		previously echoed input.
 *
 * 		After hitting this limit (and possibly warning the user),
 * 		one character may be validly entered: Rubout.
 * 		You might also make it legal to enter End Input.
 *
 * Note that the Shift, Rubout and End Input keys should not be entered
 * in \a input_buffer or echoed on the LCD.
 *
 * For convenience, here are the character translations. Note  that the x
 * is lower case.
 * 	| Key	| Unshifted	| Shifted |
 * 	| :--:	| :--:		| :--:	|
 * 	|  A	| +		| x	|
 * 	| B	| -		| /	|
 * 	| C	| .		| E	|
 * D is the shift key, End Input is asterik (*) and Rubout is hash (#).
 *
 * This function will presumably call functions in \a mid_level_funcs to
 * read each character from keyboard and print it to the LCD.

/*! Display the result of the calculation.
 *
 * \param [in] answer The number to be displayed.
 * 		Note that this is of type \a double, i.e. higher precision
 * 		floating point than \a float. This takes more memory space
 * 		and (on a small processor) more processor time, but normal
 * 		\a float can have poor enough accuracy and give bad results.
 *
 * The result should be displayed on the LCD. The text displayed must not
 * go beyond the end of the display. This probably means that it will be
 * limited to one line of 16 characters maximum. It could go on to the
 * second line, but this would make it harder to read and would be of
 * questionable benefit.
 *
 * The line(s) where the answer is displayed should be cleared first.
 * No cursor should be displayed on the line with the result.
 *
 * Some thought should be given to the format of the display, as the
 * number could be very small or very large. Four possibilities are listed
 * here, of increasing level of refinement:
 * 	1. Scientific format, e.g. 1.23E4. This will work for all numbers,
 * 		and will be needed for very large or very small ones.
 * 		However, it is clumsy for middle-size ones, e.g.
 * 		1.234E1 for 12.34.
 * 	2. Middle-size numbers displayed normally (e.g. 12.34 or -0.678),
 * 		with very large or small ones displayed in scientific
 * 		format.
 * 	3. Choosing the number of decimal places to avoid trailing zeroes,
 * 		e.g. 12.34 not 12.3400000.
 * 	4. Displaying integers as such, e.g. 42 not 42.0.
 * You should also think about the number of significant figures to display.
 * A 16-character display can accommodate a minus, a decimal point and 14
 * digits. This is equivalent to about 46-bit accuracy, which is probably
 * more than type double will provide.
 *
 * Writing software to convert a floating-point number to ASCII characters
 * would be very time-consuming. You are advised to use the \a sprintf()
 * function. You can then call PrintString() in \a mid_level_funcs with
 * the string.
 *
 * Note that this function only needs to handle valid floating-point
 * numbers. If the calculation produced anything invalid, e.g. from
 * dividing by zero, CalculateAnswer() would have issued an error
 * message.

/*! Display an error message.
 *
 * \param [in] error_message_line1 A C-format string containing the first

 * 			of 16 characters plus the trailing null.
 * \param [in] error_message_line2 A C-format string containing the second
 * 			line of the error message. It will have a maximum
 * 			of 16 characters plus the trailing null.
 *
 * This should clear the display and then display the two strings on their
 * respective lines. Since the two parts of the message may each be up to
 * 16 characters long, they should start at the left-hand end of the line.
 * No cursor should be displayed.
 *
 * These error messages are provided by the system and you may assume they
 * are no more than 17 chars long (including the trailing null). I wrote
 * these messages, and I never make misstakes.
 *
 * Actually, do you believe that? If you're a cautious programmer, you
 * will ignore what I just said and add an error check that the strings
 * are not too long.
